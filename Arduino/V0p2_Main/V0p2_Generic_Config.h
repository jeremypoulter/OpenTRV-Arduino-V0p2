 Global configuration parameters for V0.2 PCB hardware.
 The top part should contain one #define CONFIG_XXX and nothing else (uncommented).
 
 Note: the format of this needs to be managed carefully and restricted (see below)
 to allow dynamic adjustment in Continuous Integration (CI) tests
 that all primary/production configurations remain viable.

 This should only be "#include"d once by code
 since normal guards against re-inclusion may be defeated during CI processing.

#define V0P2_GENERIC_CONFIG_H


// Define/uncomment exactly one of the CONFIG_XXX flags below
// to enable a default working standard configuration set.
// Some can be specific to particular locations and boards,
// others can be vanilla ready to be configured by the end-user one way or another.
// As far as possible the configs should simply #define/#undef a set of ENABLE_XXX flags.
// There is a set of 'default' ENABLE_XXX flags which will evolve over time,
// requiring alterations to them to be tracked in individual configs.

// Any lines starting exactly with //#define CONFIG_ are primary configurations
// (plus any single 'live' config line starting #define CONFIG_)
// and all may be dynamically uncommented and tested in CI scripts for viability
// while all other #define CONFIG_ lines will be commented out
// including any current 'live' config.
// Leave space after the CONFIG_XXX token before any trailing comment.
// (None of these dynamic changes should ever be checked back in.)
